**Project Overview**

This project implements a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a Genetic Algorithm in Python. The TSP is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the origin city.

Genetic Algorithms (GA) are search heuristics that mimic the process of natural selection. In this project, the GA is used to evolve a population of possible TSP solutions over successive generations to find an optimal or near-optimal tour.

**Features**

Solves the TSP using a Genetic Algorithm approach.
Implements common GA operations such as:
- Selection (Tournament and Roulette wheel selection).
- Crossover (Order Crossover).
- Mutation (Swap Mutation).
- Elitism (Preserving the best solution across generations).
- Customizable parameters for population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, and number of generations.
